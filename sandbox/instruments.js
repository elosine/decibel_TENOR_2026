// Rendering-recipe config — decibel TENOR 2026 (the port from piece #6, the new-piece protocol's 3.4, 2026-10-04;
// container 4 fills it in). One entry per TRACK (score/public/composer.html TRACKS[].instKey).
//
// Schema, inherited from pieces #3/#4/#5: { label, port, rangeLow, rangeHigh, mechanism?,
// techniques: [{ key, label, channel, port?, cc0?, ks?, rangeLow?, rangeHigh? }] }.
//   - `port` is the loopMIDI port (case-exact); a technique's own `port` overrides it.
//   - `channel` is 1-based. `cc0` = Xsample articulation select, sent as a prelude before the
//     note. `ks` = keyswitch notes. `oneShot: true` marks presets that revert after one note.
//   - Ranges are MIDI numbers, middle C = 60, SOUNDING pitch. Written pitch is the notation
//     layer's business (notation/registry/ensemble.json), never this file's.
//   - EVERY VOICE KNOWS ITSELF (LGMF PLAN 1m.4.1, 2026-09-22; RUNNING_LOG §243 · §244): every technique entry carries
//     `kind` — `pitched` (the harmony note sounds) · `key` (the key chooses one of N named sounds: the percussion,
//     multiphonics, key clicks, noises — dealt NO pitch, its note IS the key) · `fixed` (open strings, natural harmonics:
//     the nearest to the harmony note) — and `loud`, where its loudness comes from: `vel` (velocity — the dynamics law's
//     struck note) or `mw` (the mod wheel, Xsample's `MW` presets). A `Velocity … MW` preset is `vel` with `shape: "mw"`:
//     the wheel shapes it, the velocity is its loudness. A `key` entry carries `keys: [{ midi, label }]` — the percussion's
//     from the catalog; the SI2 and Xsample by-key voices `keys: "pending"` until 1m.4.2 reads them from his rack. The
//     drawer's name rule (strike_drawer.js kindOf) is the FALLBACK for an entry without `kind`; tools/roster_check.js
//     names any such entry.
//
// ============================ STATUS: PROVISIONAL ============================
// **Nothing here has been heard in this piece.** Written during the port so that the six lanes exist, material can be
// assigned to them, the placement engines can route around them and the notation can lay them out. Container 4 (the
// instruments) and container 5 (the calibration) replace every value, with the composer at the machine.
//
//   CARRIED from piece #6, verbatim — its measurements are ITS rack's, re-measured at container 5:
//     percussion        Spitfire Abbey Road Orchestra Percussion. The selection (bank/perc_selection.json) is piece
//                       #6's fourteen; WHICH instruments this piece uses is the composer's, at container 4.
//     bowed_vibraphone  Xsample Mallets Extended — the STAND-IN for the pitched percussion lane (journal D9).
//     cello             Xsample Contemporary Solo Strings.
//   PLACEHOLDERS — no library chosen (container 4 opens with that talk):
//     bass_flute · bass_clarinet   one ordinary voice each, so the lane is real.
//     viola                        the strings' roster by the cello's mechanism; none of the cello's measurements.
//
// PORT NAMES carry a `DEC` prefix (journal D6): loopMIDI ports are machine-global, and piece #6's rack (`LG…`) and piece
// #5's (bare names) may still be live on this machine. These names are the SHAPE; container 4 (4.1) fixes them.
//
// TECHNIQUE KEYS are the notation registry's names (notation/registry/techniques.json) wherever one exists, so a key that
// reaches the IR is already drawable; tools/palette_check.js lists the recipe keys the registry does not know yet.
